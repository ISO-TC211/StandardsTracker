## Welcome to ISO/TC 211 _StandardsTracker_
As of April 2021, this replaces the previous ISO/TC 211 - CIO StandardsTracker

This GitHub repository lets you - our users - log and track issues that you find with our standards and other document. Tag the issue with the standard or standards effected; we will assign it to the relevant group(s) within TC 211.

It is monitored regularly by members of TC 211's Programme Maintenance Group and the convenors of the working groups responsible for the documents.

To raise an issue, you need to log in to GitHub. If you are not able to create a GitHub account, then do please contact us via the committee secretariat.
ISO/TC 211 Geographic information/Geomatics is responsible for the ISO geographic information series of standards. 

We have now started using GitHub Discussions. The first discussion topic is how to improve the way we're using GitHub issues.

For further information about the committee, including how to contact us other than through GitHub, see https://committee.iso.org/home/tc211.
